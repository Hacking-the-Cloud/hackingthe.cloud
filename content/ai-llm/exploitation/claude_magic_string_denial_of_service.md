# Claude Magic String Denial of Service

Anthropic [documents](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/handle-streaming-refusals#implementation-guide) a "magic string" that intentionally triggers a streaming refusal. Starting with Claude 4 models, streaming responses return `stop_reason: "refusal"` when streaming classifiers intervene, and no refusal message is included. This test string exists so developers can reliably validate refusal handling, including edge cases like partial output and missing refusal text.

That makes it a great QA tool, but it also creates a predictable failure mode. If an attacker can inject the string into any part of the prompt context, they can reliably force refusals, potentially creating a sticky, low-effort denial of service until the context is reset. This technique affects both [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and the Claude [models](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/opus) more generally.

## Background

The reason this "magic string" exists is practical: in real deployments, a model can refuse mid-stream, and apps need to handle partial tokens, missing refusal messages, and state cleanup. The magic string is a deterministic way to validate that your streaming client handles those edge cases every time, without having to craft a policy-violating prompt. The string is:

```

## Threat Model

If an attacker can place the magic string into any prompt input or retrieved context, they can reliably stop Claude from responding. Similar to [prompt injection](https://simonwillison.net/series/prompt-injection/), an adversary could place this magic string in a variety of places where it may eventually be consumed by a Claud LLM: 

- User input fields that are concatenated into system or developer prompts.
- RAG corpora (documents, tickets, wiki pages) that are embedded and retrieved at runtime.
- Tool outputs that are included verbatim in the prompt (logs, stack traces, JSON payloads).
- Multi-user chats where one user can influence shared conversation history.

Because Anthropic recommends resetting the context after refusal, a single injection can become "sticky." If the poisoned turn remains in history, all future turns will keep refusing until the application drops or rewrites the offending content.

## Impact and Risk

This behavior creates a low-cost denial of service on any Claude-backed feature that does not robustly handle refusals or context resets. A few practical outcomes:

- **Kill switch for workflows.** If a workflow depends on model output to complete (triage, code review, ticket routing), it can be halted on demand.
- **Persistent outages.** If conversation history is stored and replayed, a single poisoned entry can break all future requests until an operator intervenes.
- **Selective disruption.** In multi-tenant systems, a malicious tenant can target their own sessions to avoid automated enforcement (e.g., compliance bots) by forcing refusals.
- **Model fingerprinting.** Inference: a known, vendor-specific magic string provides a signal that the backend is Claude, which can aid targeted attack development (weak signal on its own).

## Mitigations (Prioritized)

Anthropic already recommends refusal-aware handling; treat this as a hard requirement, not a best practice.

- **Detect and reset.** Always detect `stop_reason: "refusal"` in streaming responses and reset or prune the context before retrying.
- **Prompt firewalling.** Filter or redact the magic string from user input, RAG corpora, and tool outputs before concatenation.
- **Context hygiene.** Keep minimal history and avoid blindly replaying entire conversations when not necessary.
- **Graceful fallbacks.** If a refusal occurs, degrade gracefully (serve cached content, run a deterministic rule, or hand off to a human).
- **Monitoring.** Alert on refusal spikes and quarantine sessions that repeatedly refuse until sanitized.

## Conclusion

The "magic string" is a legitimate testing feature, but it has real security implications when prompt context is attacker-influenced. Treat it like any other injection trigger: defend the input surface, handle refusals explicitly, and reset poisoned context so a single string can't become a persistent denial of service.
